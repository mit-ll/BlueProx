# BlueProx

This iOS application provides users with three types of test protocols: Structured, Situational, Free Form. As users step through the scenarious, the app will log bluetooth, and other sensor data.

The logged data will be used to develop detection algorithms to determine if you have been in proximity of another Bluetooth device for a certain period. The intent is to do so with completely anonymized data.

## Instructions

* Choose a test type and associated scenario from the home scene. 
* Fill in the forms in the subsequent scenes. 
* Get into position, and click run on the final Run Test scene. 
* Once the protocol is complete, send the data. Repeat if desired.
